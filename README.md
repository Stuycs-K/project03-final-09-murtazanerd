# THE BUCKSHOT ROULETTE

### A HIGH ROLLER

### Project Description:

The indie turn-based game [Buckshot Roulette](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2835570/Buckshot_Roulette/) by Mike Klubnika. This version will be extremely simplified for the purposes of this project, only featuring the shotgun. However if time persists more will be added, such as items, QoL features (names), etc. If needed the premise of this project may be rebranded in the case that it is considered inappropriate for school. This project is effectively a rock-paper-scissors project, except the game itself is different, and requires more information to be stored.  

As for what Buckshot Roulette is, it is a turn-based table-top game where you and one other person dance between life and death with your judge being a shotgun. Each round, start with a number of CHARGES (lives, essentially). A random assortment of bullets are loaded into the shotgun, either LIVE (ones that hurt/take one or more CHARGEs) or BLANK (ones that don't hurt/take one or more CHARGEs). The only information you are given is how many LIVEs and BLANKs were loaded into the gun at the very beginning of the round. From here, you make your choice: Gamble the shot to your opponent to deal damage or risk doing nothing, or face the front of the gun to your own chin to get another turn should it be a BLANK or risk your own life. Once one player runs out of CHARGEs, the other player walks out of that round with a briefcase full of money. But that's not all. You are given ITEMs each round that can aid you given you make the right choices, so you don't have to pray for lady luck the entire game.
